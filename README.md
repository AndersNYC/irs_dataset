# IRS Dataset

This is the work I've being doing with the dataset. I tried to leave everything on a Jupyter Notebook with annotations of what I was doing to make sure people could follow along and play around with the data.

Just make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed (comes with anaconda).

Also, you need to donwload the [csv](https://nccs-data.urban.org/data/bmf/2018/bmf.bm1812.csv). Make sure to save it in the same folder as the jupyter notebook file.
